Assignment complete by:

Matthew West (N9190325)
Lucy Webster (N9154752)

Part 1:
Matthew completed the Aircraft class and Passenger test class.
Lucy completed the Passenger class and the Aircraft test class.

Part 2:
Worked on together in person despite commits coming only from Matthew. This was done largely because of time restraints but also to decrease potential merge conflicts

This is agreed by both students.

Statement of completeness:
All completed to the best of our knowledge. A known bug is that there is sometimes a blank log file outputted when the program is launched. The GUI has implemented both the Text ouput and both graph outputs.

Command line arguments are also implemented. To trigger no GUI, the 10th argument must be "false".
